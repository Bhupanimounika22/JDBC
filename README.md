# 🛠️ JDBC-CRUD-MAVEN — The "Let Me Revise Before I Forget Again" App

Welcome to this magnificent, *totally original*, and absolutely **not copied-from-StackOverflow** CRUD app using JDBC in Maven.  
I made this to "revise the basics" — which is code for "I forgot everything and panicked." 😅

---

## 🤔 What's This?

A glorious Java project using:

- **JDBC** – because Hibernate is still a commitment I’m not ready for.
- **Maven** – because managing JARs manually is so 2005.
- **CRUD Operations** – Create 🧙, Read 👀, Update 🔄, Delete 💣  
Just like life, you create something, read too much into it, update your mistakes, and delete the evidence.

## 📦 What’s Inside?

- `insert()` – Adds data like you add items to your cart and never check out.
- `read()` – Pulls out records like your brain pulling out childhood trauma.
- `update()` – Fixes your data, not your life.
- `delete()` – Removes data *guilt-free*. If only emotions had a `.delete()` too.
